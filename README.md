This is my first real attempt at a simple CLI app using Rust. The idea came from a tutorial I was doing, but I implemented it all myself afterwards. 
I'm pretty happy with my progress!

I am going to implement some kind of db file for permanent saving next!

Any comments are welcome!

Thanks for looking!
